She finds that her children, growing up in the city, are denied this and she comes to these gatherings in the hope of cultivating that same knowledge, this time with the trees that will one day line the streets of the neighborhood. Just as pioneer species create the conditions for new ecosystems to take hold, these inhabitants position themselves as pioneers, cultivating practices in the constrained terrain of the contemporary city.",

To explore this, I chose to film a sown forest that has grown over thirty years as a collaborative land art practice initiated by the artist Fabrice Hyber in Vendée. This forest offered a counterpoint to the mineralized urban environment where sown trees have over time created the conditions for conviviality amongst species, weaving together a living ecosystem. For Hyber, the forest is not separate from his imagination but an extension of it, and his artwork, in turn, bears the traces of that entanglement. Throughout the forest, he has made massive sculptures that act as agents of perception: a wooden humanoid fountain surrounded by different plant species, for instance, makes visible the sociality of plants and how they live amongst themselves. The installation leaves behind marks of a process in which the forest and the artist continuously shape one another.",

On the outskirts of Paris, in Saint-Denis, the river La Vieille Mer was buried in the 20th century to facilitate construction and mobility, and today it is set to be reopened. For this fieldwork, I take part in collective gatherings organized around a map of the territory, bringing together local inhabitants of Saint-Denis. Many have forgotten the existence of the river, except for a few elders. Larger questions begin to emerge around the role of water in the fabric and maintenance of the territory, and how these polluted rivers were buried to conceal the toxicity in the environment. The gatherings reflect on a reimagined sponge city, where soils retain water rather than letting it disappear into drainage and sewers. The urgency, after this amnesia of water, becomes: how do we commemorate water in our territory, given its foundational role in the creation of life? As the local inhabitants of Saint-Denis search for the river and begin to understand where rainwater is retained or channeled, they express the necessity to make it visible.",

Here too, the aim is to make water visible, to restore an awareness of its role in the fabric of life. The question of commemoration becomes important insofar as it projects water management into a longue durée⁵, allowing inhabitants to conceive of a way to remember water that will not be forgotten, and that there is a necessity to remember for the long term.",

En périphérie de Paris, à Saint-Denis, la rivière La Vieille Mer a été enterrée au XXe siècle pour faciliter la construction et la mobilité, et il est aujourd'hui prévu de la rouvrir. Pour ce travail de terrain, je participe à des rassemblements collectifs organisés autour d'une carte du territoire, réunissant des habitants locaux de Saint-Denis. Beaucoup ont oublié l'existence de la rivière, à l'exception de quelques anciens. De plus grandes questions commencent à émerger autour du rôle de l'eau dans le tissu et l'entretien du territoire, et de la façon dont ces rivières polluées ont été enterrées pour dissimuler la toxicité de l'environnement. Les rassemblements réfléchissent à une ville éponge réimaginée, où les sols retiennent l'eau plutôt que de la laisser disparaître dans les drainages et les égouts. L'urgence, après cette amnésie de l'eau, devient : comment commémorer l'eau dans notre territoire, compte tenu de son rôle fondateur dans la création de la vie ? Alors que les habitants locaux de Saint-Denis cherchent la rivière et commencent à comprendre où l'eau de pluie est retenue ou canalisée, ils expriment la nécessité de la rendre visible.",

Cela me ramène à la forêt en Vendée, où Fabrice Hyber développe un projet de redistribution de l'eau qui permet à l'eau de la rivière Doulaye de circuler plus librement à travers le terrain vivant. Là aussi, l'objectif est de rendre l'eau visible, de restaurer une conscience de son rôle dans le tissu de la vie. La question de la commémoration devient importante dans la mesure où elle projette la gestion de l'eau dans une longue durée⁵, permettant aux habitants de concevoir une façon de se souvenir de l'eau qui ne sera pas oubliée, et qu'il est nécessaire de garder à long terme.",
